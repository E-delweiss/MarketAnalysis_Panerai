/* The objective of this exercise is to perform an SQL query in order to find the most 
* recent retail price corresponding to each offer in the "Offer" table.
*/

/* For a better understanding of the problem:
* The retail prices (studied in the previous exercise) of each reference are contained 
* in the "Reference_price" table below. While the main table "Offer" contains watch 
* offers retrieved from a website such as ebay.com. 
*/


------------------------------

/* First, requesting columns with the max of the dates
* Second, linking both RefPriceTable and OfferTable with the 'Reference_code'
* Third, grouping by 'Reference_code' and 'Retail_currency'
* Fourth, creating a view of this table, called 'myView'
* Fifth, selecting only columns that matter 
*/
